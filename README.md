# 🏡 Linguistate: Breaking Language Barriers, Connecting Conversations  

### 🚀 Real Estate Communication Assistant  

In India’s real estate market, agents communicate with clients in multiple languages—Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, English, and more. These multilingual conversations contain crucial details about client preferences, but much of this information is lost due to a lack of structured recording, analysis, and follow-ups.  

**Linguistate** solves this problem by providing **real-time transcription, translation, and smart conversation management** for brokers and clients.

## 🌟 Our Solution: Linguistate  

Linguistate is a **web-based platform** that allows brokers and clients to connect through a shared session before their business call. The system **transcribes and translates conversations live**, ensuring that both parties communicate effortlessly in their preferred language.  

### 🔹 How It Works  

1. **Live Conversation:**  
   - The broker speaks in **Marathi**, and the client speaks in **Hindi** (or any other preferred language).  
   - **Linguistate** instantly transcribes and translates the conversation for both parties in real-time.  

2. **Example Scenario:**  
   - A broker asks a client about their property preference in Marathi.  
   - The client sees the message in their preferred language (e.g., Hindi or English).  
   - When the client responds, the broker receives the reply in Marathi.  

3. **After the Session:**  
   - A **broker-oriented summary** is generated in the broker’s language.  
   - A **client-oriented summary** is generated in the client’s language.  
   - Key details are extracted for future reference, follow-ups, and deal management.
